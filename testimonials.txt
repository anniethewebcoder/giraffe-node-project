"I knew Abigal and I were a perfect match the night I was walking home from the bar after last call and found her practicing her katana skills in the cemetery."

"I used to believe that thing people say about how you can't change a person, but then I met Haley.  You'd never believe a farmer's wife and mother of 2 used to be such a stuck up party girl!"

"Shane was really nervious during our first date.  Then I said "lets go to the Stardrop Saloon, I'm buying" and he almost broke out in a run.  We really connected over our shared love of jalapeno poppers!"

"I used to visit Robin's supply shop every Monday morning for years.  I never even knew she had a son until one day I heard him arguing with his dad over playing with his band in the city.  He's not really my type, but the family discount has be fantastic for my farm."

"Penny is that kind of sweet, kindergarten teacher we all want for our kids.  I didn't even realize we were dating until we were holding hands on a bridge in the moonlight.  I'm glad my grandfather's ghost appeared and told me to go for it, or neither of us would have ever made a move!"

"I never thought about Kent that way, but when he found me passed out from fighting ice skeletons, I realized we could connect over our shared wartime trama.  He even left his wife for me.  He's my hero!"

"I'm so glad I met Annie through PTMF!  She always knows just which trash cans have the freshest food.  What a romantic date night!"

"I was afraid to date since it involves going outside.  But Sebastian invited me to meet him in his mom's basement and I haven't left since!  Who needs vitamin D when you have vitamin L-O-V-E?"

"I was so nervous that Leah would think I was cheap for taking her beachcombing on our first date.  But when she showed me her driftwood sculptures later that night, I knew she was the one."
